  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the first overpowering shock
  <span class="german">

  Mr. Dick

  Mr. Peggotty had

  Hungerford

   over

  <span class="sanskrit">
   this

   dare

  say,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  <span class="norse">
   many

  Mr. Dick justly observed

   As

  <span class="german">
   he

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="germanic">

  <span class="sanskrit">
   soon

  bitterly reproved
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  <span class="sanskrit">
   this

  harshness,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  <span class="greek">
   his

   turn

  pale,
  <span class="english">
   and

  tears

   course
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   down

  <span class="greek">
   his

  <span class="german">
   he

  fixed
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon

  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   look

  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   such
  </span>
  unutterable woe,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  <span class="french">
   might

   a

   far
  </span>
  harder
  <span class="german">
   heart
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  mine. I took infinitely greater pains
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  cheer
  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   up
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   again

  <span class="latin">

  I had taken

   depress

  him;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I
  <span class="sanskrit">
   soon
  </span>
  understood (as I

   ought

  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   have

   at

  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="german">
   he

   so
  </span>
  confident, merely
  <span class="french">
   because
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="greek">
   his

  unbounded reliance

  <span class="german">

  </span>
  considered
  <span class="french">
   a

   of

  mortal. 'What

  <span class="german">
   we
