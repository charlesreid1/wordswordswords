   CHAPTER 37. A LITTLE COLD WATER
  </h2>
  My
  <span class="english">
   new

  <span class="greek">
   life
  </span>
  had lasted
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  week,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  stronger
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   ever
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   those
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   tremendous
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   practical
  </span>
  resolutions
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I felt the
  <span class="french">
   crisis
  </span>
  required. I continued
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  walk extremely fast,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   have
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   general

  <span class="greek">
   idea
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  getting on. I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   rule
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">

  </span>

   much

   out

   myself

  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  doing everything
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  I applied my energies. I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made

  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  perfect
  <span class="french">
   victim
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="oldnorse">
   even

   some

  <span class="greek">
   idea

   on

   a

   a

  Dora.
  <span class="greek">
   As
