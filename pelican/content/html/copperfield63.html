   CHAPTER 62. A LIGHT SHINES ON MY WAY
  </h2>
  The
  <span class="german">
   year
  </span>
  came round
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  Christmas-time,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I had been
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   home
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   above
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   two
  </span>
  months. I had seen Agnes frequently. However
  <span class="germanic">
   loud
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   general
  </span>
  voice
  <span class="french">
   might
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   be
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  giving
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  encouragement,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  however
  <span class="french">
   fervent
  </span>
  the emotions
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  endeavours
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  roused me, I heard her lightest
  <span class="german">
   word
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  praise
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  I heard
  <span class="french">
   nothing
  </span>
  else.
  <span class="norse">
   At
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   least
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   once
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  week,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  sometimes oftener, I rode
  <span class="sanskrit">
   over
  </span>
  there,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  passed the evening. I usually rode
  <span class="french">
   back
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  night;
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  the
  <span class="english">
   old
  </span>
  unhappy sense
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   always
  </span>
  hovering
  <span class="oldfrench">
   about
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  now—most sorrowfully
  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  I
  <span class="german">
   left
  </span>
  her—and I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   glad
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   be
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   up
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  out,
  <span class="greek">
   rather
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  wandering
  <span class="sanskrit">
   over
  </span>
  the past
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   weary
  </span>
  wakefulness
  <span class="sanskrit">
   or
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   miserable
  </span>
  dreams. I wore
  <span class="oldfrench">
   away
  </span>
  the longest
  <span class="french">
   part
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   many
  </span>
  wild
  <span class="german">
   sad
  </span>
  nights,
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   those
  </span>
  rides; reviving,
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  I went, the thoughts
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  had occupied
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

   long
  </span>

   to

  the echoes
  <span class="german">

  <span class="french">
   those
  </span>
  thoughts, I should
  <span class="sanskrit">
   better
  </span>
  express the truth.
  <span class="french">
   They
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   spoke
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   afar

  off. I had
  <span class="sanskrit">
   put
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   them
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  distance,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  accepted my

   inevitable
  </span>
  place.
  <span class="german">
   When
  </span>
  I read
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  Agnes

   what
  </span>
  I wrote;
  <span class="german">
   when

  I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   saw

  her listening face; moved her
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  smiles
  <span class="sanskrit">
   or
  </span>
  tears;
  <span class="english">
   and

  heard her

   so
