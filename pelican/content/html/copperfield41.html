   that

  <span class="oldfrench">
   about

  the

   have
  </span>
  detailed
  <span class="french">
   in

  the

   last

  <span class="french">
   aunt

  <span class="french">
   deeply
  </span>
  interested

  them,
  <span class="english">
   and

  walked
  <span class="germanic">
   up

   down

   more

   two

  <span class="latin">
   she

   these

  the amount

   state

   a

  week;

  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

   bitter

  day,

  <span class="french">
   a

   blown

   some

  <span class="oldfrench">
   down

  <span class="english">
   with

  the light,

   and
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  the
  <span class="germanic">
   snow

   come

  on.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="french">
   a

  heavy, settled fall, I recollect,
  <span class="french">
   in

  <span class="oldnorse">
   great

  <span class="english">
   and

  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

   noise

  <span class="german">

  wheels

  </span>
  tread
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   people
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   were

  <span class="greek">

   if

  the streets had been strewn

   that

  <span class="sanskrit">
   depth

   with

   on
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   such

  gives its

  <span class="greek">
   As

  I passed the steps

  the portico, I encountered,
  <span class="norse">
   at

  the corner,
  <span class="french">
   a

  woman's face.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

   across
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   narrow
  </span>
  lane,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  disappeared. I knew it. I had seen
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  somewhere. But I
  <span class="french">
   could
  </span>
  not

   with
  </span>
  it,

   that

  struck
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon

  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  confused.
  <span class="sanskrit">
   On
