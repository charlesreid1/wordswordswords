  so,
  <span class="german">
   when

  <span class="americanenglish">
   one
  </span>
  evening,
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">

  returning

   from

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="french">
   solitary

   was

   success

  had steadily increased
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  my steady application,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  engaged

   at

  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

   time
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon
  </span>
  my first
  <span class="norse">
   work
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  fiction—I came past Mrs. Steerforth's house. I had
  <span class="french">
   often
  </span>
  passed
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  before,
  <span class="french">
   during
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   residence
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="greek">
   never

  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  I
  <span class="french">
   could
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   choose

  <span class="french">
   another
  </span>
  road. Howbeit,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   did
  </span>
  sometimes
  <span class="french">
   happen
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  not
  <span class="french">
   easy
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  find another, without making
  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="americanenglish">
   long
  </span>
  circuit;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  I had passed
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  way,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon
  </span>
  the whole, pretty often. I had
  <span class="greek">
   never

  <span class="americanenglish">
   more

  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  glance

   at

  the house,
  <span class="greek">
   as

  I went
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  quickened step.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  had been uniformly gloomy
  <span class="english">

  dull.
  <span class="oldnorse">
   None

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  the road;
  <span class="english">
   and

  the narrow, heavily-framed
  <span class="oldfrench">
   old-fashioned
  </span>
  windows,
  <span class="greek">
   never
  </span>

  <span class="latin">
   any

  circumstances, looked
  <span class="french">
   very

  dismal, close shut,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   their
  </span>

  <span class="french">
   always

   was

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="sanskrit">
   way

   across

  <span class="french">

  <span class="germanic">
   was

   and

  there

   was

  <span class="americanenglish">
   one

  round staircase window,
  <span class="norse">
   at

  odds

   which

  had the

   same

  unoccupied

   blank

  <span class="norse">
   do

  not

   remember

  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I

   If

   have

  <span class="norse">
   some

  <span class="latin">
   If

   knowledge

  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the place,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  had seen
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  <span class="french">
   often
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  pleased my fancy

  <span class="norse">
   many
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   ingenious

  speculations, I

   dare

  say.
  <span class="greek">
   As
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  was, I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   thought
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   little
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  <span class="greek">
   as

  I might. But my

   mind

  <span class="french">
   could
  </span>
  not
  <span class="americanenglish">
   go
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

   it

  <span class="english">
   and

  <span class="norse">
   leave

  it,
  <span class="greek">

  my

  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

   a

  <span class="americanenglish">
   long

  <span class="french">
   train
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  meditations. Coming before me,
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  <span class="sanskrit">
   this

  <span class="french">
   particular
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   evening
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I mention, mingled

   with
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   childish
  </span>
  recollections
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  later fancies, the ghosts
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  half-formed hopes, the
  <span class="french">
   broken
  </span>
  shadows
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  disappointments dimly seen
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  understood, the blending

   of

  experience

   and
  </span>
  imagination,
  <span class="french">
   incidental

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  the
  <span class="french">
   occupation
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with

  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  my thoughts had been busy,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  commonly suggestive. I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   fell
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   into
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  brown

  I walked on,

  <span class="french">
   a

  voice
  <span class="norse">
   at

  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

  <span class="germanic">
   was

   was

  not

  <span class="french">
   in

  recollecting Mrs. Steerforth's
