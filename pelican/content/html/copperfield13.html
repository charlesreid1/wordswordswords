  <span class="french">
   In

  <span class="french">
   due

  <span class="greek">
   His
  </span>
  creditors
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  not implacable;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  Mrs. Micawber informed
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   even
  </span>
  the revengeful boot-maker had declared
  <span class="french">
   in

  <span class="french">

  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  no malice, but
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="german">
   when

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him

  <span class="german">
   He

  <span class="oldfrench">
   thought

   it

  <span class="germanic">

  </span>
  the King's
  <span class="french">
   Bench
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   when

   he

  <span class="french">
   could

   him
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with

  <span class="english">
   and

   after

  drinking the toast

  <span class="french">
   a
