   CHAPTER 59. RETURN
  </h2>
  I
  <span class="french">
   landed
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  London
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  dark
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  raining,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   saw

   more

   and
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   mud

  <span class="french">
   in

  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   minute
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  I had seen
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  year. I walked
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  the Custom
  <span class="greek">
   House
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   Monument

  before I found
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  coach;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  although the
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  house-fronts, looking
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   swollen
  </span>
  gutters,
  <span class="french">
   were

   that

  <span class="french">
   they
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very

  dingy friends. I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   have
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   often
  </span>
  remarked—I
  <span class="french">
   suppose
  </span>
  everybody has—that one's going
  <span class="oldfrench">
   away
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="greek">
   As

  I looked

   out

  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the coach window,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  observed

   that

   old

  <span class="greek">
   house

   on

  <span class="french">
   a

   down

   a

  <span class="german">

  time-honoured insalubrity
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  inconvenience,
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  being drained
  <span class="english">

  widened; I half expected
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  find St. Paul's
  <span class="oldfrench">
   Cathedral
  </span>
  looking older.
  <span class="oldnorse">
   For

  <span class="norse">
   some

  changes
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the fortunes
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  my friends, I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  prepared. My

  <span class="americanenglish">
   long

  been re-established
  <span class="norse">
   at

  Dover,

  Traddles had begun

  <span class="german">
   He

  had chambers
  <span class="french">
   in

  Gray's Inn, now;
  <span class="english">

  had told me,

   They

   idea

  <span class="german">

   so

  I

  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  <span class="english">
   And

  yet, I

   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   perverse

   enough

  rattling, alone

  silent, through the

  streets. The well-known shops, however,
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   their

  cheerful lights,
