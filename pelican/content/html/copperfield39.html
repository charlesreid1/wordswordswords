   CHAPTER 38. A DISSOLUTION OF PARTNERSHIP
  </h2>
  I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   did
  </span>
  not
  <span class="oldfrench">
   allow
  </span>
  my resolution,
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   respect
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  the Parliamentary Debates,
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  cool.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   one
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  the irons I began
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   heat
  </span>
  immediately,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   one
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the irons I kept hot,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  hammered at,
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   perseverance
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   may
  </span>
  honestly admire. I bought an approved scheme
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   noble
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   art
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   mystery
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

   me

  </span>
  sixpence);
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  plunged
  <span class="oldfrench">
   into

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="germanic">
   sea
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   perplexity

   a

   few
  </span>
  weeks,
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  the confines

  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   rung

   that

  <span class="french">

  </span>
  resulted

   from

  marks

  <span class="german">
   When
