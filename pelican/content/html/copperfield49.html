   CHAPTER 48. DOMESTIC
  </h2>
  I laboured
  <span class="oldnorse">
   hard
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  my book, without allowing
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   interfere
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   punctual
  </span>
  discharge
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  my newspaper duties;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  came
  <span class="oldenglish">
   out
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  successful. I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  not stunned
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  the praise
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  sounded
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  my ears,
  <span class="french">
   notwithstanding
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   keenly
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   alive
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  it,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   thought
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   better
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  my
  <span class="sanskrit">
   own
  </span>
  performance, I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   have
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   little
  </span>
  doubt,
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  anybody
  <span class="latin">
   else
  </span>
  did.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  has
  <span class="french">
   always
  </span>
  been
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   observation
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   human
  </span>
  nature,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

   a

  <span class="welsh">
   man

  <span class="latin">
   any

  <span class="french">
   good
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   reason
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">

  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   believe

   himself

   never

  <span class="french">

  <span class="german">

  <span class="english">
   other

  <span class="french">
   people
  </span>
  <span class="french">

   that

   may
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   believe

   in
  </span>
  him.
  <span class="oldnorse">
   For
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   this
  </span>
  reason, I retained my
  <span class="french">
   modesty
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  self-respect;

  the

  praise I got, the

  I tried

   to

  deserve.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

  <span class="oldfrench">

  <span class="french">
   They

  express themselves,
  <span class="english">

  I

   leave

   them

  <span class="german">
   When

  <span class="oldfrench">

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="french">
   part

   me

   with

  confidence. Without
  <span class="latin">
   such

  I should certainly

   left

  <span class="oldfrench">

   on

  <span class="norse">
   some

   have

  tried

   to

  find
  <span class="oldenglish">
   out

  <span class="germanic">

   new

   success

   escape

  <span class="americanenglish">
   One

   down

  the
