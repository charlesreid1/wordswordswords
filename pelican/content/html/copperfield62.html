  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

   bright

  <span class="french">
   often

   his

  <span class="norse">
   at

  first,
  <span class="sanskrit">
   why
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   so

  <span class="french">
   often

   up

  I appeared,

  hurried

   it

   into

  the table-drawer. But the
  <span class="oldfrench">
   secret
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   soon
  </span>
  came out.
  <span class="americanenglish">
   One

  day, Traddles (who had

  <span class="germanic">
   home

  through the drizzling sleet
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

  Court) took
  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="german">

   that

   who
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  warming
  <span class="greek">
   his

   in

  <span class="french">
   a
