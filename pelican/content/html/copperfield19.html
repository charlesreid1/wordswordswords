  My school-days! The

   silent
  </span>
  gliding
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  <span class="german">

  my existence—the unseen, unfelt

  <span class="german">
   of

  my life—from
  <span class="french">
   childhood

   to

  <span class="oldnorse">
   Let

  <span class="french">
   back
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon

  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="french">
   a

   how

   it

  <span class="french">
   A

  I

  the
