   that

  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   so

  <span class="sanskrit">
   little

   They

  <span class="french">
   They

  through the wild roar,
  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="french">
   hush

  <span class="norse">
   at

  </span>
  whispered. I knew why.
  <span class="french">
   They
  </span>
  felt
  <span class="greek">
   as

  <span class="latin">
   if

  <span class="german">
   We

  <span class="greek">
   burden

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="germanic">
   So

  <span class="sanskrit">
   soon

  <span class="greek">
   as

   could

  my thoughts, I sent

  Joram,
  <span class="english">

  begged

   of

  <span class="greek">
   as

   night

  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  the journey,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  nearly
  <span class="french">
   midnight

  <span class="oldfrench">
   Upon

   which

  the

  its covered

   quite

  gone down,

  <span class="french">
   nothing
