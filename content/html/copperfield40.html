   CHAPTER 39. WICKFIELD AND HEEP

  My aunt, beginning, I imagine,

  <span class="norse">
   be
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made
  </span>
  seriously uncomfortable
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  my prolonged dejection,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  pretence
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  being
  <span class="french">
   anxious
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I should
  <span class="americanenglish">
   go
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  Dover,
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   see
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

   well
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  the cottage,
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="english">

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="french">
   conclude
  </span>
  an agreement,

  tenant,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  longer term
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>

  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  drafted
  <span class="oldfrench">
   into
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   service
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  Mrs. Strong,
  <span class="germanic">
   where
  </span>
  I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   saw
  </span>
  her
  <span class="french">
   every
  </span>
  day.
  <span class="latin">
   She
  </span>

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  <span class="latin">

  <span class="oldfrench">
   much

  <span class="greek">
   as

   because

  <span class="latin">
   she
  </span>
  happened not

  <span class="norse">
   like
