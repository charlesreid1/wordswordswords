   Until

   on

  I

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  Dora

  </span>
  coffee.
  <span class="french">
   In
  </span>
  my love-lorn condition, my
  <span class="french">
   appetite
  </span>
  languished;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="greek">
   glad
