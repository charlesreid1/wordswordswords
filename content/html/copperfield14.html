  <span class="german">

   next

  <span class="french">
   pipe

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  its head, against the door-post, went
  <span class="oldfrench">
   into
  </span>
  the shop, followed
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  me, snuffed the
  <span class="germanic">
   two

  the counter,

  looked

   it

   up

   at

   it

  <span class="english">

  </span>
  ultimately said: 'What

   you

   after

   rob

  <span class="german">
   he

  said, 'if I

  <span class="sanskrit">
   This
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="french">
   disagreeable

  <span class="sanskrit">
   way
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  putting the business;
  <span class="french">
   because
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  imposed
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon
  </span>
  me,
  <span class="french">
   a

  perfect stranger, the unpleasantness
  <span class="german">

  my account. My circumstances being
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  pressing, however, I said I would
  <span class="oldfrench">
   take
  </span>
  ninepence

  it,
  <span class="latin">

  <span class="german">
   he

  <span class="norse">
   some
  </span>
  grumbling, gave ninepence. I wished
  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   good
  </span>
  night,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  walked
  <span class="oldenglish">
   out

  <span class="german">

  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  I buttoned my jacket,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  not much. Indeed, I foresaw pretty clearly
