  </h2>
  All
  <span class="sanskrit">
   this
  </span>
  time, I had gone
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   loving
  </span>
  Dora, harder
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  ever. Her
  <span class="greek">
   idea
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   refuge
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  disappointment
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  distress,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   some
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   amends
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  me,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   even

   for

  the
  <span class="oldfrench">
   loss
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

  my friend. The
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  I pitied myself,
  <span class="sanskrit">
   or
  </span>
  pitied others, the
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  I sought
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   consolation
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   image
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  Dora. The greater the
  <span class="french">
   accumulation
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   deceit
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   trouble
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  </span>
  the purer shone the star
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  Dora high
  <span class="latin">
   above
  </span>
  the world. I don't
  <span class="norse">
   think

   any

  <span class="germanic">

   am

  <span class="french">
   quite
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   sure
  </span>
  I should

   have
  </span>
  scouted the

   notion

  <span class="german">
   of

   If

  <span class="german">
   Enough
