  <h2>
   Telemachus

  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

  the stairhead, bearing
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  bowl
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="greek">

  crossed.
  <span class="french">
   A
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   yellow

  dressinggown, ungirdled,
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  sustained gently
  <span class="french">
   behind

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  the

   mild

  <span class="french">
   morning

  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  held the bowl

  </span>
  intoned: Halted,
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  peered
  <span class="oldfrench">
   down
  </span>
  the dark winding stairs
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  called
  <span class="oldenglish">
   out
  </span>
  coarsely: —Come up, Kinch!
  <span class="english">
   Come
  </span>
  up,
  <span class="germanic">
   you
  </span>
  fearful jesuit! Solemnly
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  came forward
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  mounted the round gunrest.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  faced
  <span class="oldfrench">
   about
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  blessed gravely
  <span class="french">
   thrice
  </span>
  the tower, the surrounding
  <span class="germanic">
   land
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and

  the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  Stephen Dedalus,
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  bent
  <span class="french">
   towards
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   rapid

  crosses
  <span class="french">
   in

  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  sleepy, leaned
  <span class="greek">
   his
  </span>
  arms
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  the
  <span class="greek">
   top
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the staircase
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  looked coldly
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  the shaking gurgling face
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  blessed him,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   equine
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  its length,
  <span class="english">
   and

  <span class="norse">
   at

  the
  <span class="german">
   light
  </span>
  untonsured hair, grained

   and
  </span>
  hued
  <span class="norse">
   like

  <span class="french">
   pale

  <span class="french">
   instant

  under the
  <span class="oldfrench">
   mirror
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   then
  </span>
  covered the bowl smartly. —Back

   to
  </span>
  barracks!
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  said sternly.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  added
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  preacher's tone: —For this, O

  <span class="french">
   Slow

  <span class="oldfrench">
   Shut

  your eyes, gents.

  <span class="french">
   those

  corpuscles. Silence, all.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  peered sideways
  <span class="germanic">
   up

  <span class="english">
   and

  gave

   then

  paused

   awhile

  <span class="germanic">
   Two
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   strong

  shrill whistles answered through the calm. —Thanks,
  <span class="english">
   old

  chap,
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  cried briskly.
  <span class="oldnorse">

  <span class="german">
   He

  skipped

   off

  the gunrest

  looked gravely

   at

  Greek!
  <span class="german">
   He

   over

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  the parapet, laughing
  <span class="germanic">
   to

   him
  </span>
  wearily halfway
  <span class="english">
   and

  sat
  <span class="oldfrench">

  lathered cheeks

  <span class="french">
   gay

  dreadful?
  <span class="german">
   he

  said frankly.
  <span class="french">
   A

  <span class="german">
   He
