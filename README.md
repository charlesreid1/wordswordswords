# Words Words Words

This repo contains Python code for tagging words based on their etymology.
You can get more information from the [Words Words Words web site](http://charlesreid1.github.io/wordswordswords)
or by browsing this repository.

I am using the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML, the Mechanize 
library to look up words on the [Online Etymology Dictionary](http://etymonline.com),
and Pelican to manage static content for the web site.
