  ran away; and, my

  <span class="french">
   several

   if

  <span class="german">

  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   this
  </span>

  assented;
  <span class="english">

  </span>
  particularly small
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

   leisure

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="french">

  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

   a

   a

   up

  <span class="english">
   with

  whitening,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  <span class="sanskrit">
   most

   contents

  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   two

  <span class="french">

   a

   on

   was

  written,
  <span class="french">
   in

  my mother's hand, 'For Davy.
  <span class="english">
   With

  my love.' I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   overcome
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  this,
  <span class="oldnorse">

  </span>
  I

  I wiped my eyes

   on

  my

  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  stopped myself.
  <span class="oldnorse">
   For

   consequence
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of

   still

  <span class="english">

   a

   stormy

  <span class="latin">
   After

  <span class="norse">
   some

  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>

   that
