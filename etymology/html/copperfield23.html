  Steerforth

  <span class="oldfrench">
   Thus
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  came about,

  the

  the

  <span class="german">
   of

  </span>
  the distinguished things I

  <span class="germanic">

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  no

  <span class="french">
   were

   great

  changes

   in

   so

   a
