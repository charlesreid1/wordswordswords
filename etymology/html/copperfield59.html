  <span class="americanenglish">

  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>

   night
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  gathered
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  me, haunted
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  the ghosts
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="norse">
   many

   many

  errors,
  <span class="norse">
   many

  unavailing sorrows
  <span class="english">
   and

  regrets. I went
  <span class="oldfrench">
   away
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  England; not knowing,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   even
  </span>
  then,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   how
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   great
  </span>
  the shock was,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I had
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  went away;

  I had borne it,

  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

   left

   with

  the

   which
  </span>

   upon

  me, not quickly, but
  <span class="sanskrit">
   little

   and

   grain

   with

  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  I went abroad, deepened
  <span class="english">
   and

  <span class="norse">
   At
  </span>
  first
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>

   a

  heavy sense
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="oldfrench">
   loss

  <span class="oldnorse">
   By

  <span class="french">
   imperceptible

  degrees,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  became
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  hopeless consciousness
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  all
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  I had lost—love, friendship, interest;
  <span class="german">
   of

  all
  <span class="oldnorse">

  my life;
  <span class="german">

  waste, lying
  <span class="sanskrit">
   wide
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   around

  me, unbroken,
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  the dark horizon.
  <span class="latin">
   If

  my

  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

  her blooming world,
  <span class="germanic">
   so

  young. I mourned

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him

  <span class="german">
   who
  </span>
  <span class="french">

  <span class="french">

   mine

  <span class="americanenglish">
   long

  the
  <span class="french">
   broken
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   heart
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  had found
  <span class="norse">
   rest

  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   stormy
  </span>
  sea;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  the wandering remnants
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   simple
  </span>
  home,
  <span class="germanic">
   where
  </span>
  I had heard the night-wind blowing,
  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  child.
  <span class="sanskrit">
   From
  </span>
  the accumulated sadness
  <span class="oldfrench">
   into
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  I fell, I had
  <span class="norse">
   at

  <span class="greek">
   length
  </span>
  no
  <span class="french">
   hope
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   ever
  </span>
  issuing again. I roamed
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   place
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  place, carrying my
  <span class="greek">
   burden
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  everywhere. I felt its
  <span class="latin">
   whole
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   weight
  </span>
  now;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I drooped beneath it,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  I said
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  my
  <span class="german">
   heart
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it

  <span class="french">
   could
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   never
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   be
  </span>
  lightened.
  <span class="german">
   When
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   this
  </span>
  despondency
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  its worst, I believed
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I should die. Sometimes, I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   thought
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I would
  <span class="norse">
   like

  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   die
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  home;
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  actually turned
  <span class="french">
   back
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  my road,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I
  <span class="french">
   might

  <span class="greek">
   get
  </span>
  there soon.
  <span class="norse">
   At
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   other
  </span>
  times, I passed
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   farther
  </span>
  away,—from
  <span class="french">
   city
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  city, seeking I
  <span class="germanic">
   know

  not what,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  trying
  <span class="germanic">
   to

   leave
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   know

  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   is
  </span>
  not
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  my power
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  retrace,
  <span class="americanenglish">
   one

   by

  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   distress
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   mind

  I passed. There
  <span class="oldfrench">
   are

  <span class="norse">
   some

  dreams
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="greek">
   can

  <span class="latin">
   only
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   be
  </span>
  imperfectly
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  vaguely described;
  <span class="english">
   and

  <span class="german">
   when

  <span class="germanic">

   be
  </span>
  recalling

   such

   a

   myself
  </span>
  passing
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

   among

  the novelties
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   foreign

  towns, palaces, cathedrals, temples, pictures, castles, tombs,
  <span class="greek">
   fantastic

  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   History

   and

  Fancy—as

   a

  <span class="french">
   hardly

  <span class="oldfrench">
   conscious

   as

  <span class="french">
   they

  <span class="french">
   fade

  before me. Listlessness
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  everything, but brooding sorrow,
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  the
  <span class="german">
   night
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="oldfrench">
   fell
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

   undisciplined

  <span class="oldnorse">
   Let

  it—as

   at

  Heaven!—and
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from

  its long, sad, wretched dream,

   to

  dawn.
  <span class="oldnorse">
   For
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   many

  months I travelled
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   this
  </span>
  ever-darkening
  <span class="oldfrench">
   cloud
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   upon

  my mind.
  <span class="norse">
   Some

  blind reasons

  I had
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  not returning home—reasons
  <span class="norse">
   then

   for

  <span class="americanenglish">
   more

   distinct
  </span>
  expression—kept
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  my pilgrimage. Sometimes, I had proceeded restlessly

   from
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   place

  <span class="germanic">
   to

   long
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   one
  </span>
  spot. I had had no purpose, no sustaining soul within me, anywhere. I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  Switzerland. I had
  <span class="english">
   come

  <span class="oldenglish">
   out

  <span class="german">

  Italy,

   If
