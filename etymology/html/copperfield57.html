   which
  </span>
  I

   so

  <span class="sanskrit">

   They

   a

  <span class="norse">
   at

  whispered. I knew why.
  <span class="french">
   They
  </span>
  felt
  <span class="greek">

  <span class="latin">
   if

  <span class="german">
   We

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="germanic">
   So

  <span class="sanskrit">
   soon

   as

   could

  begged

   of

  the journey,

   that

   midnight

   Upon

  the

  its covered

   quite

  gone down,

  <span class="french">
   nothing
