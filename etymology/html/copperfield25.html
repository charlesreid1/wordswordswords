  <span class="oldfrench">
   It

  <span class="germanic">

  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  the depths
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the earth,
  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  I wanted herâ€”and
  <span class="german">
   when

  <span class="latin">
   she
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  disposed
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  come. All this, I say,
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  wonderfully fine; but I
  <span class="sanskrit">
   must
  </span>
  say, too,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  there
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  times
  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very

  dreary.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   fine
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the morning, particularly
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   fine
  </span>
  mornings.
  <span class="oldfrench">
   It
  </span>
  looked
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  fresh,
  <span class="norse">
   free
  </span>
  life,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  daylight:
  <span class="latin">
   still

  fresher,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  free,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by

  sunlight. But
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  the
  <span class="germanic">
   day
  </span>
  declined, the
  <span class="greek">
   life
  </span>
  seemed
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   go
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   down
  </span>
  too. I don't

   know
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   how
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  was;
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   seldom
  </span>
  looked
  <span class="americanenglish">
   well
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  candle-light. I wanted somebody
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  talk to, then. I missed Agnes. I found
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   tremendous

  blank,
  <span class="french">
   in

   that
  </span>
  smiling

   repository

  <span class="german">

  my confidence. Mrs. Crupp appeared
  <span class="germanic">
   to

   be

  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   long

  <span class="sanskrit">
   way
  </span>
  off. I
  <span class="oldfrench">
   thought
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   about
  </span>
  my predecessor,
  <span class="german">
   who
  </span>
  had died
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="german">
   drink

   and

   could

   have

   so

  <span class="french">
   good

   me

   with

   After
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   two
  </span>
  days
  <span class="english">
   and

  nights, I felt
  <span class="greek">
   as

  <span class="latin">
   if

  I had lived there
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for

  <span class="greek">
   yet

  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="french">
   quite

  <span class="greek">
   as

  <span class="oldfrench">
   much

   left

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

   out

  Highgate. Mrs. Steerforth

   to

  <span class="germanic">
   see

   another

  St. Albans, but
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

  <span class="latin">
   she

   him
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="french">
   return
  </span>
  tomorrow. I
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   fond

  <span class="german">
   of

  him,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that

   jealous

   to

  <span class="germanic">
   to

  <span class="english">
   and

  I

   believe

  <span class="german">
   we

   about

  <span class="french">
   nothing

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him

  <span class="sanskrit">
   full

   of

  hints
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   mysterious

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="oldnorse">
   great

  <span class="french">
   interest

   our

  <span class="germanic">
   so

   was

   natural

   to

   several
