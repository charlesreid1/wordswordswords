   CHAPTER 14. MY AUNT MAKES UP HER MIND ABOUT ME
  </h2>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   On
  </span>
  going
  <span class="oldfrench">
   down
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  the morning, I found my
  <span class="french">
   aunt
  </span>
  musing
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  profoundly
  <span class="sanskrit">
   over
  </span>
  the
  <span class="latin">
   breakfast
  </span>
  table,
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  her elbow
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  the tray,
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  the
  <span class="french">
   contents
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the
  <span class="oldfrench">
   urn
  </span>
  had overflowed the teapot
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  laying the
  <span class="latin">
   whole
  </span>
  table-cloth under water,
  <span class="german">
   when
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   entrance
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   put
  </span>
  her meditations
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  flight. I felt
  <span class="french">
   sure
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I had been the
  <span class="french">
   subject
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  her reflections,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   more
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   than
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   ever
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   anxious
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="germanic">
   know
  </span>
  her intentions
  <span class="french">
   towards
  </span>
  me.
  <span class="greek">
   Yet
  </span>
  I dared not express my anxiety,
  <span class="french">
   lest
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  should
  <span class="oldnorse">
   give
  </span>
  her offence. My eyes, however, not being
  <span class="germanic">
   so
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   much
  </span>
  under control
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  my tongue,
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  attracted
  <span class="french">
   towards
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   aunt
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   often
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   during
  </span>
  breakfast. I
  <span class="greek">
   never
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   could
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   look
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  her
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   few
  </span>
  moments
  <span class="greek">
   together
  </span>
  but I found her looking
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  me—in an
  <span class="french">
   odd
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   thoughtful
  </span>
  manner,
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   if
  </span>
  I
  <span class="french">
   were
  </span>
  an
  <span class="french">
   immense
  </span>
  <span class="sanskrit">
   way
  </span>
  off,
  <span class="greek">
   instead
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  being
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on
  </span>
  the
  <span class="english">
   other
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   side
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the small round table.
  <span class="german">
   When
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   she
  </span>
  had finished her breakfast, my
  <span class="french">
   aunt
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   very
  </span>
  deliberately leaned
  <span class="french">
   back
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  her chair, knitted her brows, folded her arms,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  contemplated
  <span class="english">
   me
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  her leisure,
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  <span class="latin">
   such
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a

  fixedness
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   attention
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  I
  <span class="germanic">
   was
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   quite
  </span>
  overpowered
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  embarrassment. Not having
  <span class="greek">
   as
  </span>
  <span class="greek">
   yet
  </span>
  finished my
  <span class="sanskrit">
   own
  </span>
  breakfast, I attempted
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   hide
  </span>
  my
  <span class="french">
   confusion
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   by
  </span>
  proceeding
  <span class="english">
   with

  <span class="sanskrit">
   over
  </span>
  my fork, my fork tripped
  <span class="germanic">
   up
  </span>
  my knife, I chipped bits
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="french">
   bacon

  eating,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  choked
  <span class="french">
   myself
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   with
  </span>
  my tea,
  <span class="latin">
   which
  </span>
  persisted
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  going the
  <span class="german">
   wrong

  <span class="sanskrit">
   way

   instead

  <span class="german">

  the

   right

  <span class="french">
   until
  </span>
  I gave
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  altogether,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  sat blushing under my aunt's close scrutiny. 'Hallo!' said my aunt,
  <span class="latin">
   after
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  <span class="americanenglish">
   long

  time. I looked up,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  met her sharp
  <span class="norse">
   bright
  </span>
  glance respectfully. 'I
  <span class="oldnorse">
   have
  </span>
  written
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  him,' said my aunt. 'To—?' 'To your father-in-law,' said my aunt. 'I
  <span class="oldnorse">

  <span class="french">

   up

   think
