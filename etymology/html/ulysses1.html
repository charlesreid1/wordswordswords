  Stately, plump Buck Mulligan came
  <span class="sanskrit">
   from
  </span>
  the stairhead, bearing
  <span class="french">
   a
  </span>
  bowl
  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="greek">
   lather

  <span class="french">
   A

  <span class="oldfrench">
   yellow

  dressinggown, ungirdled,
  <span class="germanic">
   was

  sustained gently

   behind

  <span class="oldfrench">
   him

  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  the

  <span class="german">
   He

  </span>
  intoned: Halted,
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  peered
  <span class="oldfrench">
   down

  the dark winding stairs
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  called
  <span class="oldenglish">
   out
  </span>
  coarsely: —Come up, Kinch!
  <span class="english">
   Come
  </span>
  up,
  <span class="germanic">
   you
  </span>
  fearful jesuit! Solemnly
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  came forward
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  mounted the round gunrest.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  faced
  <span class="oldfrench">
   about
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  blessed gravely
  <span class="french">
   thrice
  </span>
  the tower, the surrounding
  <span class="germanic">
   land
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  Stephen Dedalus,
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  bent
  <span class="french">
   towards
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   him
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="oldfrench">
   made

  <span class="french">
   rapid

   in

  the air, gurgling

  </span>
  shaking

   his

  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  sleepy, leaned
  <span class="greek">
   his
  </span>
  arms
  <span class="sanskrit">
   on

  the
  <span class="greek">
   top
  </span>
  <span class="german">
   of
  </span>
  the staircase
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  looked coldly
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  the shaking gurgling face
  <span class="oldnorse">
   that
  </span>
  blessed him,
  <span class="oldfrench">
   equine
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   in

  the

  hued
  <span class="norse">
   like

  under the

   mirror
  </span>
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   then

  covered the bowl smartly. —Back

  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  said sternly.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  added
  <span class="french">
   in
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="german">
   He

  peered sideways

  <span class="germanic">
   Two

   He
