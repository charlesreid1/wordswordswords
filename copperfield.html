   'Not dead, too! Oh, she's not dead, Peggotty?'

  <p>
   Peggotty cried
   <span class="oldenglish">

   'Go on, Peggotty,' said I,

    more

   'Master Davy,' said Peggotty, untying her

   I trembled,

  <p>
   'A

  <p>
   Peggotty gave

    a

  <p>
   I ceased

   'Now, Clara my dear,' said Mr. Murdstone. 'Recollect! control yourself,
