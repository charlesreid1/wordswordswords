   made

  no

   of

  the compliment. 'I gave your message, Mr. Barkis,' I said: 'I wrote

   to
  </span>
  Peggotty.' 'Ah!' said Mr. Barkis. Mr. Barkis seemed gruff,
  <span class="english">
   and
  </span>
  answered drily. 'Wasn't
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  right, Mr. Barkis?' I asked,

   after

  <span class="french">

   me

   back

  <span class="germanic">

  <span class="germanic">
   you
  </span>
  told her so, Mr. Barkis?' 'No—no,' growled Mr. Barkis, reflecting
  <span class="oldfrench">
   about
  </span>
  it. 'I ain't got no

  <span class="latin">

  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="oldfrench">
   nod

  <span class="german">
   of

  <span class="greek">
   his
  </span>
  head. 'Peggotty.' 'Chrisen name?
  <span class="sanskrit">
   Or

  nat'ral name?' said Mr. Barkis. 'Oh, it's not her Christian name. Her Christian
  <span class="english">
   name
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   is
  </span>
  Clara.' 'Is
  <span class="oldfrench">
   it
  </span>
  though?' said Mr. Barkis.
  <span class="german">
   He
  </span>
  seemed
  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  find an
  <span class="french">

  <span class="german">
   of

   reflection
  </span>

   in

  <span class="sanskrit">
   this

  sat pondering

  </span>
  <span class="french">
   inwardly
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   whistling
  </span>
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="norse">
   some
  </span>
  time. 'Well!'
  <span class="german">
   he
  </span>
  resumed
  <span class="norse">
   at
  </span>
  length. 'Says you, "Peggotty! Barkis
  <span class="norse">
   is
  </span>
  waitin'
  <span class="oldnorse">
   for
  </span>
  <span class="french">
   a

  <span class="germanic">
   to
  </span>
  what?" Says you, "To
  <span class="german">
   what
  </span>
  I told you." "What

  <span class="sanskrit">
   This

  extremely artful

  Mr. Barkis accompanied

  <span class="french">
   a
